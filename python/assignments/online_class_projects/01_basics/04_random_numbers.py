Problem Statement

Print 10 random numbers in the range 1 to 100.

Here is an example run:

45 79 61 47 52 10 16 83 19 12

Each time you run your program you should get different numbers

81 76 70 1 27 63 96 100 32 92

Recall that the python random library has a function randint which returns an integer in the range set by the parameters (inclusive).
For example this call would produce a random integer between 1 and 6, which could include 1 and could include 6:

value = random.randint(1, 6)
"""
from random import randint
for i in range(1,11):
    print(randint(1,100))
